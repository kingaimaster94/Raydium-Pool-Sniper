# This is Raydium-Jito-Token-Sniper fork.
# NOTE: To snipe all pools leave tokenAddress in settings blank, to snipe only 1 pool add your token address :)

# Intructions:

    a) Run `npm i`.  

    b) Put your blockengine keypair inside of blockengine.json.  

    c) Edit the ./settings.ts with all commented fields

    d) Edit the ./src/config.ts with the closest blockengine to your rpc.  For example the default is `frankfurt.mainnet.block-engine.jito.wtf` and you could change it to `ny.mainnet.block-engine.jito.wtf`.  THIS MAXIMIZES SPEEEEEEED!!!!

    e) Run `ts-node snipe.ts`
